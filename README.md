# 🧠 Predicting Customer Ad Clicks Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a user will click on a digital advertisement based on features such as **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is `DigitalAd_dataset.csv`, which includes:

- **Age**: Age of the user
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated annual salary
- **Purchased**: Whether the user clicked on the ad (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

This is a binary classification problem.

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## ⚙️ Project Steps

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-Test split
- Logistic Regression model fitting
- Predicting outcomes for test data
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation
- Predicting based on new user inputs

## ✅ Model Accuracy

The model achieved an accuracy of **80.0%** on the test dataset.
